/**
 * ==========================================================================
 * Calibre-UI — IdentifierRows
 * The App 07 Metadata Editor "Identifiers" key/value rows editor.
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `IdentifierRows` is the composition component for the "Identifiers" region in
 * the right column of the App 07 Metadata Editor modal (Figma screen `9:9`,
 * sub-nodes `9:102` label · `9:103`/`9:107`/`9:111` rows · `9:115` "+ Add ID")
 * of the UI-only Calibre e-book-manager prototype (Next.js 15 App Router ·
 * React 19 · TypeScript 5 strict · Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-first tokens). It renders
 * a small "Identifiers" label above a vertical stack of editable identifier rows
 * — each a `scheme` (key) field, a `value` field, and a destructive remove
 * control — followed by a "+ Add ID" button that appends a new blank row.
 *
 * It is a LEAF composition component built ENTIRELY from two design-system
 * primitives — {@link InputField} (the controlled key / value text inputs) and
 * {@link Button} (the per-row danger remove control and the secondary "+ Add ID"
 * action). It renders NO raw `<input>`, `<button>`, or heading element of its own
 * (AAP §0.4.5 — compose from primitives only).
 *
 * UI-ONLY / MOCK (AAP §0.1.2 · §0.9)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * There is no backend, no persistence, no network, and no validation against
 * real identifier registries (ISBN check-digits, Amazon ASIN format, …).
 * Adding / removing / editing identifier rows mutates ONLY the parent's React
 * state via the controlled callbacks — the `rows` array is fully owned by the
 * parent `MetadataDialog`. The Calibre design-parity reference
 * `src/calibre/gui2/metadata/basic_widgets.py` (`IdentifiersEdit`, ~L1690) is a
 * single comma-separated `scheme:value` line editor (e.g.
 * `isbn:1565927249, doi:10.1000/182, amazon:1565927249`) WITH ISBN validation;
 * per the file contract its validation and single-line packing are deliberately
 * NOT replicated — this is a plain, per-row key/value editor. Nothing is
 * imported or translated from the Python codebase; it informs behavior only
 * (identifiers are `scheme → value` pairs such as `isbn`, `amazon`,
 * `goodreads`, `google`).
 *
 * WHY `'use client'`
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rows bind `onChange` / `onClick` event handlers (key edits, value edits,
 * row removal, row addition), so this must be a Client Component — App Router
 * components default to Server Components, which cannot attach event handlers.
 * The directive is the very first line, before any import. The component is
 * SSR-safe and hook-free: it holds NO local state (it is fully controlled), and
 * there is no `window` / `Math.random` / `Date.now` / `crypto` / `localStorage`
 * access, so it renders identically on the server and client and hydrates
 * without warnings.
 *
 * FULLY CONTROLLED, NO LOCAL STATE (the state contract)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The identifier `rows` live ENTIRELY in the PARENT (`MetadataDialog`): this
 * component never copies them into local state and never mutates them directly.
 * Every edit is reported upward through a callback — `onChangeKey(id, key)` /
 * `onChangeValue(id, value)` for in-place edits, `onRemoveRow(id)` for deletion,
 * and `onAddRow()` to append a blank row. Each row carries a stable `id` (the
 * parent's responsibility to keep stable across renders) that is used directly
 * as the React list key, so rows can be removed or reordered without React
 * reusing the wrong DOM node or warning about duplicate / index-based keys.
 *
 * The parent derives `rows` from a `Book.identifiers` map ({@link IdentifierMap},
 * a `Record<string, string>`) by mapping its entries to `{ id, key, value }`
 * triples, and can re-serialize back to a map on Save with
 * `Object.fromEntries(rows.map((r) => [r.key, r.value]))` — but Save is a
 * UI-only no-op in this prototype. An ordered `IdentifierRow[]` (rather than the
 * `Record` itself) is the prop shape because a `Record<string, string>` cannot
 * be edited ergonomically while a KEY is mid-typing (the key IS the map's
 * index): an explicit, id-keyed row array decouples a row's React identity from
 * its still-changing `key`.
 *
 * FIGMA SOURCE OF TRUTH (file `JduUzjVHNhZivm5A0pAiCD`, page `0:1`)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Reconciled via analyze_figma_node on the App 07 modal (`9:9`), Identifiers
 * region (sits directly BELOW the Tags chip editor `9:81`, which ends at y402,
 * and ABOVE the Synopsis textarea `9:117`, which begins at y590):
 *   • Label `9:102`           — the string "IDENTIFIERS", Inter SemiBold 600
 *                               10px, fill `#3A4060`, authored uppercase.
 *   • 3 rows `9:103/107/111`  — each 580×32, radius 7px, fill rgba(29,33,72,0.5),
 *                               1px rgba(255,255,255,0.06) border, holding a KEY
 *                               text (`#64748B`), a 1px×24 vertical divider, and
 *                               a VALUE text (`#94A3B8`). key:value ≈ 15.5%:84.5%
 *                               (divider at x90 of 580). Inter-row gap 6px.
 *   • "+ Add ID" `9:115`      — 120×28 hug-width, left-aligned, neutral fill
 *                               rgba(255,255,255,0.04), 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.07)
 *                               border, radius 6px, label "+ Add ID" `#64748B`.
 *
 * BLITZY [DESIGN] (editable rows vs. the static Figma rows — scope/intent):
 * The Figma frame is a STATIC display snapshot: each row is a single read-only
 * box split into KEY | divider | VALUE TEXT, with NO per-row remove control
 * (analyze_figma_node confirmed each row FRAME has exactly three children —
 * key text, 1px divider, value text — and explicitly noted "a remove affordance
 * is NOT part of the current Figma spec; if required by product behavior it must
 * be added as a new element"). This prototype's contract requires an
 * INTERACTIVE editor (AAP §0.1.1 "stateful interactions … backed by React
 * state"; §0.3.1 Workflow 5 — the Metadata Editor is editable), and the file's
 * agent contract — which has precedence over the subagent on scope/intent —
 * mandates each row be composed as a key {@link InputField}, a value
 * {@link InputField}, and a danger remove {@link Button}, with a secondary
 * "+ Add ID" {@link Button}. So the STRUCTURE follows the editable-editor
 * contract (three discrete primitive controls per row, replacing the static
 * single divided box), while the VISIBLE VALUES map to the same `@theme` tokens
 * the Figma resolves to. The per-row remove control is the deliberately-added
 * "new element" the subagent flagged; it uses the destructive `danger` Button
 * variant — the semantically correct treatment for a delete action.
 *
 * BLITZY [DESIGN] (the "Identifiers" label): analyze_figma_node reports label
 * `9:102` as `#3A4060`, Inter SemiBold 600, 10px, authored uppercase. Two
 * deliberate, convention-aligned reconciliations are made (identical to the
 * sibling `TagChipEditor`'s "Tags" label):
 *   • COLOR + WEIGHT → `text-text-muted` (`#64748B`) + `text-meta-label`
 *     (Inter 400 / 10px). This matches BOTH the file contract's explicit
 *     directive ("--color-text-muted + --text-meta-label" for the label) AND the
 *     established codebase convention, where `text-text-muted` is the app-wide
 *     muted-LABEL token and `--color-text-placeholder` (`#3A4060`) is RESERVED
 *     for input placeholders; using the placeholder token for a label would
 *     break that convention. The weight delta (600→400) is imperceptible at
 *     10px and matches every sibling meta-label usage.
 *   • CASE → the `uppercase` utility (text-transform only — carries no
 *     color/size token) honors Figma's authoritative uppercase field-label case
 *     on a dimension the contract leaves open, while the accessible DOM text
 *     stays "Identifiers".
 *
 * BLITZY [DESIGN] (key field width + "+ Add ID" variant): The Figma display key
 * column is ~90px (≈15.5% of the 580px row); the editable key field here uses a
 * slightly wider `w-28` (112px ≈ 19%) so scheme names like "goodreads" fit
 * comfortably while still reading clearly as the narrower of the two fields
 * (value `flex-1`). The "+ Add ID" Figma button is a neutral quiet box
 * (rgba(255,255,255,0.04) fill / rgba(255,255,255,0.07) border / `#64748B` text
 * / 6px radius); per the agent contract it is realized with the design system's
 * `secondary` Button variant (white-6% fill / white-9% border / `#94A3B8` text /
 * 8px radius), whose values are within token-snapping tolerance of the Figma box
 * and keep the prototype's add-action treatment consistent app-wide.
 *
 * BLITZY [DESIGN] (scheme-key casing): the Figma static mock labels the keys
 * "ISBN" / "Amazon" / "Goodreads", but this is an EDITABLE key field and `row.key`
 * is rendered VERBATIM — the component applies no `.toLowerCase()` / `.toUpperCase()`
 * and no CSS case transform (a `capitalize` transform could not produce both the
 * all-caps acronym "ISBN" and the title-case "Amazon" from one rule, and visually
 * transforming an editable input's text would desync what the user sees from what
 * is stored). The scheme key's case is therefore owned entirely by the parent's
 * `rows` data, which derives from `Book.identifiers` whose keys are the canonical
 * Calibre identifier scheme ids — conventionally lowercase (`isbn`, `amazon`,
 * `goodreads`, `google`, `doi`; cf. the design-parity reference `IdentifiersEdit`).
 * The empty-field `placeholder` ("e.g. isbn") reinforces that canonical lowercase
 * form. Presenting capitalized display labels, if ever desired, is a parent/data
 * concern, not a transform this controlled editor should impose.
 *
 * ZERO-HARDCODED-TOKEN RULE (AAP §0.4.5)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every COLOR / TYPOGRAPHY value resolves to an `@theme` token from
 * `src/app/globals.css`: the label is `text-text-muted` (`--color-text-muted`)
 * + `text-meta-label` (`--text-meta-label`). The field surface / border / radius
 * / placeholder colors and the button fills / borders / text colors / radii live
 * INSIDE the `InputField` and `Button` primitives, so this file declares NO
 * color / radius / typography literals at all. The only bare utilities here are
 * LAYOUT / appearance values that carry no color information — Tailwind's
 * standard spacing / flex scale (`flex`, `flex-col`, `w-full`, `gap-2.5`,
 * `gap-1.5`, `gap-1`, `items-center`, `w-28`, `shrink-0`, `flex-1`, `min-w-0`,
 * `self-start`) and the `uppercase` text-transform — all permitted (matching the
 * sibling primitives' and `TagChipEditor`'s usage). The three vertical gaps
 * reproduce the CONFIRMED Figma rhythm EXACTLY: `gap-1` (4px) label→first row
 * (`9:102`→`9:103`), `gap-1.5` (6px) inter-row (`9:103`→`9:107`→`9:111`), and
 * `gap-2.5` (10px) last row→"+ Add ID" button (`9:111`→`9:115`).
 *
 * RESPONSIVE INTEGRITY (1440 → 1280, zero horizontal overflow — AAP §0.9)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Each row is a `flex items-center` line whose value field is `flex-1 min-w-0`,
 * so the value absorbs ALL available and ALL reclaimed width: the fixed-width
 * key field (`w-28 shrink-0`) and the intrinsic-width remove button
 * (`shrink-0`) keep their size while the value field shrinks toward zero rather
 * than pushing the row past its container. The `min-w-0` is the critical guard —
 * without it a long unbroken value string would establish a min-content floor
 * and force horizontal overflow. The metadata column (~580px) far exceeds the
 * row's minimum, so the layout holds cleanly from the 1440px baseline down to
 * the 1280px floor.
 *
 * ACCESSIBILITY
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * • The "Identifiers" label is a non-interactive `<span>` (NOT a heading — it
 *   must not pollute the document outline). Visible label text is preserved.
 * • Each key / value `InputField` is given an explicit, position-based
 *   `aria-label` ("Identifier N scheme" / "Identifier N value") so the
 *   label-less inputs have clear, unique accessible names (the `InputField`
 *   primitive requires the caller to supply one).
 * • Each row's remove control is a real, keyboard-operable `Button` whose
 *   visible content is the "✕" glyph; an `aria-label` ("Remove identifier: …")
 *   overrides the glyph as the accessible name so screen-reader users hear a
 *   descriptive action rather than a punctuation character.
 * • The "+ Add ID" control is a real `Button` whose visible label is its
 *   accessible name.
 * • Color is never the sole signal — the destructive remove action carries the
 *   "✕" glyph in addition to its danger-tinted styling.
 *
 * @see src/components/primitives/InputField.tsx — the controlled input primitive.
 * @see src/components/primitives/Button.tsx       — the action primitive (danger / secondary).
 * @see src/app/globals.css — the authoritative `@theme` token declarations.
 * @see Agent Action Plan §0.3 (App 07) / §0.4.2 — component & token mapping.
